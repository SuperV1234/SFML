## How to build

### Windows

1. Get and install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/)

2. Open a MSYS shell (see [MSYS2 Environments](https://www.msys2.org/docs/environments/)) and run the following command:

    ```bash
    pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-ninja mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-clang mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-clang-tools-extra mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-cmake git mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-lld 
    ```

3. Open a UCRT64 shell (see [MSYS2 Environments](https://www.msys2.org/docs/environments/))

4. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vittorioromeo/VRSFML
    ```

5. Enter the directory and run CMake with one of the presets:

    ```bash
    cd VRSFML
    cmake --preset vrdev_clang
    ```

6. Enter the preset build directory and run `ninja`:

    ```bash
    cd build_vrdev_clang
    ninja
    ```

7. If the build succeeded, you should now be able to run examples directly from the build directory using the `run_example.sh` script:

    ```bash
    ../run_example.sh island
    ```

8. For Emscripten support, run the following command:

    ```bash
    pacman -S mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-ninja mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-clang mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-clang-tools-extra mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-emscripten
    ```

9. Open a CLANG64 shell (UCRT64 is bugged with Emscripten at the moment) (see [MSYS2 Environments](https://www.msys2.org/docs/environments/))

10. In the main repository directory, run:

    ```bash
    cmake --preset vrdev_emcc
    cd build_vrdev_emcc
    ninja
    ```

11. If the build succeeded, you should now be able to run examples directly from the build directory using the `run_emscripten_example.sh` script:

    ```bash
    ../run_emscripten_example.sh island
    ```
